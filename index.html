                                    I am primarily interested Modern Philosophy (Descartes - Kant) and the Ancient Greek Philosophers Plato and Aristotle. My master's thesis was on Kant's Transcendental Arguments and my dissertation research focused on the first Critique's use of the Modal Categories (Possibility, Actuality, and Necessity).  My favorite Modern Philosophers include Kant, Hume, Locke, Leibniz, and Descartes.  I have also spent significant time working Aristotle's <i>De Anima</i> and Plato's <i>Meno</i>.

                                    I returned to school in 2012 to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science.  I spent a year taking catch-up courses where I filled the gaps in my education and earned a teaching assistantship for the following two years.  The Computer Science Department at UNO gave me the opportunity to pursue my interests in application development, as well as foster an interest in machine learning.

                                    <h5>M.A., Philosophy, May 2010</h5>
                                    I pursued a PhD in Philosophy at Tulane University from 2003 - 2012.  I loved my time engaging with the intellectually curious, digging deeply into problems, and learning to communicate abstract concepts effectively.  While I did not complete my dissertation work, I walked away with a Master's degree and many years of teaching experience.  Perhaps most importantly, I gained a profound respect for those academics who are able to juggle coursework, teaching, and research - all while navigating a highly-competitive job market!

                                            I earned a fellowship to study at Freie Universität in Berlin for the 2008-2009 school year.  During my time in Berlin, I took German Language courses, engaged with the other graduate students at the ISB, and pursued my research on Immanuel Kant.

                                            In 2009, I was a graduate fellow at the Murphy Institute's Center for Ethics and Public Affairs.  The year provided me the opportunity to complete another chapter of my dissertation.  I was also able to invite one of my favorite Kant scholars, Robert Hanna, to be a guest lecturer.

                                    Although I began as a Computer Science major, I was quickly pulled into the new world of liberal arts.  In four years, I earned majors in Psychology, Anthropology, and Philosophy.  Along the way, I graduated from the Honors College, organized events as Vice President of the Philosophy Forum, and was a member of Psi Chi National Honors Association in Psychology.

                                    I attended a small public school in Western New York with a class size of about 30 students until we merged with another school my Junior Year.   Our classes were so small, one year I even had to play basketball in order for the team to have enough players!  My primary extracurricular activity was the student yearbook.  With two or three others, I worked on every aspect of the publishing process - selling adds, cross-checking class lists with headshots, capturing candid pictures, documenting major accomplishments, delivering layouts to the publisher, and finally presenting the final product to my classmates.                                </div>
